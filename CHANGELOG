0.5.0 (unreleased)
------------------

This is a cleaned up version of 0.4. The goal was to do only the minimum
necessary to get the site back online (although I did just a tad more than
minimum, but not much more). Other improvements may or may not be forthcoming.

The major changes:

- Things were a mess due to some aborted starts on upgrades, modernization,
  feature additions, and so forth. The first step was to clean that up.

  - Fixed distribution name: byCycleTripPlanner => bycycle.tripplanner.

  - Removed .egg-info directory from repo (it's a generated directory).

  - Copied templates and static files from the rb-0.4 release branch, since
    those were the last known good, working versions.

  - Removed TriMet stuff--at one point I had the idea that I'd try to add
    a TriMet base layer to the map.

- Removed everything related to the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, region. I'd love to
  support more than just Portland, but that's just not feasible at this time.

- Removed the silly red dot from the center of the map. The "find at center"
  stuff should be replaced with a map context menu that has items like
  "What's here", "Zoom in/out", "Directions from/to here", etc.

- Ported from Pylons to Pyramid. This was a pretty straightforward port,
  although I did clean up a few things along the way. See 85a42710f2df.

- Upgraded all Python dependencies to latest versions.

- Upgraded prototype.js from 1.5 to 1.7.1. (Should probably switch to jQuery or
  something.)

- Simplified GMaps API key setup. Possible now that GMaps allows using the same
  key for multiple subdomains (IIRC, this wasn't possible way back in the day).

- Changed production deployment environment to Nginx/uWSGI instead of Apache
  proxying to Paste server. Also, it's now Buildout based instead of...
  whatever it was before (virtualenv?).

- Added "one-touch" deployment capability via Fabric script.

- Simplified static file serving in production by using a seperate subdomain.

- Cleaned up tests. Added more tests.

- General package cleanup: removed crufty, unused packages, modules, files, and
  so forth.

- Added this change log.
